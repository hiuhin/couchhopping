The user's dashboard contains a list of cities which the users can explore. Upon clicking on a city, a pool of other users who live in that city appears. Users can checkout the user's profile and their home information. Home information includes sleeping arrangements and the host's preferences, like how many people they can host and whether or not the host allows kids, smokers, etc.
